(Lights up on Aaron Burr & the company.)


How does a bastard, orphan, son of a whore and a
Scotsman, dropped in the middle of a forgotten
Spot in the Caribbean by providence, impoverished, in squalor
Grow up to be a hero and a scholar?


The ten-dollar Founding Father without a father
Got a lot farther by working a lot harder
By being a lot smarter
By being a self-starter
By fourteen, they placed him in charge of a trading charter


And every day while slaves were being slaughtered and carted
Away across the waves, he struggled and kept his guard up
Inside, he was longing for something to be a part of
The brother was ready to beg, steal, borrow, or barter


Then a hurricane came, and devastation reigned
Our man saw his future drip, dripping down the drain
Put a pencil to his temple, connected it to his brain
And he wrote his first refrain, a testament to his pain


Well, the word got around, they said, "This kid is insane, man"
Took up a collection just to send him to the mainland
"Get your education, don't forget from whence you came, and
The world's gonna know your name. What's your name, man?"


Alexander Hamilton
My name is Alexander Hamilton
And there's a million things I haven't done
But just you wait, just you wait...


When he was ten his father split, full of it, debt-ridden
Two years later, see Alex and his mother bed-ridden
Half-dead sittin' in their own sick, the scent thick


And Alex got better but his mother went quick


Moved in with a cousin, the cousin committed suicide
Left him with nothin' but ruined pride, something new inside
A voice saying


"You gotta fend for yourself." 
"Alex, you gotta fend for yourself."

He started retreatin' and readin' every treatise on the shelf


There would have been nothin' left to do
For someone less astute
He woulda been dead or destitute
Without a cent of restitution
Started workin', clerkin' for his late mother's landlord
Tradin' sugar cane and rum and all the things he can't afford
Scammin' for every book he can get his hands on
Plannin' for the future see him now as he stands on
The bow of a ship headed for a new land
In New York you can be a new man    

Scammin'

Plannin'
Oooh...

In New York you can
Be a new man-
In New York you can
Be a new man-  
Just you wait!

Just you wait!

In New York you can be a new man-


In New York-    

New York-

Just you wait!


Alexander Hamilton

We are waiting in the wings for you

You could never back down
You never learned to take your time!

Oh, Alexander Hamilton

When America sings for you
Will they know what you overcame?
Will they know you rewrote the game?
The world will never be the same, oh


The ship is in the harbor now
See if you can spot him

Another immigrant
Comin' up from the bottom

His enemies destroyed his rep
America forgot him  

Alexander Hamilton

Waiting in the wings for you

You never learned to take your time!

Oh, Alexander Hamilton
Alexander Hamilton...
America sings for you
Will they know what you overcame?
Will they know you rewrote the game?
The world will never be the same, oh



Just you wait


Just you wait
We fought with him

Me? I died for him


Me? I trusted him

Me? I loved him


And me? I'm the damn fool that shot him


There's a million things I haven't done
But just you wait!


What's your name, man?


Alexander Hamilton!










AARON BURR, SIR

1776. New York City

Pardon me. Are you Aaron Burr, sir?

That depends. Who's asking?

Oh, well, sure, sir
I'm Alexander Hamilton, I'm at your service, sir
I have been looking for you

I'm getting nervous

Sir...
I heard your name at Princeton. I was seeking an accelerated course of study when I got sort of out of sorts with a buddy of yours. I may have punched him. It's a blur, sir. He handles the financials?

You punched the bursar

Yes!
I wanted to do what you did. Graduate in two, then join the revolution. He looked at me like I was stupid, I'm not stupid

So how'd you do it? How'd you graduate so fast?

It was my parents' dying wish before they passed

You're an orphan. Of course! I'm an orphan
God, I wish there was a war!
Then we could prove that we're worth more
Than anyone bargained for...

Can I buy you a drink?

That would be nice

While we're talking, let me offer you some free advice
Talk less

What?

Smile more

Ha

Don't let them know what you're against or what you're for

You can't be serious

You wanna get ahead?

Yes

Fools who run their mouths off wind up dead

Yo yo yo yo yo!
What time is it?

Show time!

Like I said...

Show time! Show time! Yo!
I'm John Laurens in the place to be!
Two pints o' Sam Adams, but I'm workin' on three, uh!
Those redcoats don't want it with me!
Cuz I will pop chick-a pop these cops till I'm free!

Oui oui, mon ami, je m'appelle Lafayette!
The Lancelot of the revolutionary set!
I came from afar just to say "Bonsoir!"
Tell the King "Casse toi!" Who's the best?
C'est moi!

Brrrah brraaah! I am Hercules Mulligan
Up in it, lovin' it, yes I heard ya mother said "Come again?"

Ayyyyy

Lock up ya daughters and horses, of course
It's hard to have intercourse over four sets of corsets...

Wow

No more sex, pour me another brew, son!
Let's raise a couple more...

To the revolution!

Well, if it ain't the prodigy of Princeton college!

Aaron Burr!

Give us a verse, drop some knowledge!

Good luck with that: you're takin' a stand
You spit. I'm 'a sit. We'll see where we land

Boooo!

Burr, the revolution's imminent. What do you stall for?

If you stand for nothing, Burr, what'll you fall for?

Ooh
Who you?
Who you?
Who are you?

Ooh, who is this kid? What's he gonna do?







MY SHOT

I am not throwing away my shot!
I am not throwing away my shot!
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot!
I'm 'a get a scholarship to King's College
I prob'ly shouldn't brag, but dag, I amaze and astonish
The problem is I got a lot of brains but no polish
I gotta holler just to be heard
With every word, I drop knowledge!
I'm a diamond in the rough, a shiny piece of coal
Tryin' to reach my goal. My power of speech: unimpeachable
Only nineteen but my mind is older
These New York City streets get colder, I shoulder
Ev'ry burden, ev'ry disadvantage
I have learned to manage, I don't have a gun to brandish
I walk these streets famished
The plan is to fan this spark into a flame
But damn, it's getting dark, so let me spell out the name
I am the-

A-L-E-X-A-N-D
E-R-we are-meant to be...

A colony that runs independently
Meanwhile, Britain keeps shittin' on us endlessly
Essentially, they tax us relentlessly
Then King George turns around, runs a spending spree
He ain't ever gonna set his descendants free
So there will be a revolution in this century
Enter me!

(He says in parentheses)

Don't be shocked when your hist'ry book mentions me
I will lay down my life if it sets us free
Eventually, you'll see my ascendancy

And I am not throwing away
My shot
I am not throwing away
My shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot   
My shot!

My shot!




And I'm not throwing away my shot.

I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
It's time to take a shot!

I dream of life without a monarchy
The unrest in France will lead to 'onarchy?
'Onarchy? How you say, how you say, 'anarchy?'
When I fight, I make the other side panicky
With my-

Shot!

Yo, I'm a tailor's apprentice
And I got y'all knuckleheads in loco parentis
I'm joining the rebellion cuz I know it's my chance
To socially advance, instead of sewin' some pants!
I'm gonna take a-

Shot!

But we'll never be truly free
Until those in bondage have the same rights as you and me
You and I. Do or die. Wait till I sally in
On a stallion with the first black battalion
Have another-

Shot!

Geniuses, lower your voices
You keep out of trouble and you double your choices
I'm with you, but the situation is fraught
You've got to be carefully taught:
If you talk, you're gonna get shot!

Burr, check what we got
Mister Lafayette, hard rock like Lancelot
I think your pants look hot
Laurens, I like you a lot
Let's hatch a plot blacker than the kettle callin' the pot...
What are the odds the gods would put us all in one spot
Poppin' a squat on conventional wisdom, like it or not
A bunch of revolutionary manumission abolitionists?
Give me a position, show me where the ammunition is!

Oh, am I talkin' too loud?
Sometimes I get over excited, shoot off at the mouth
I never had a group of friends before
I promise that I'll make y'all proud

Let's get this guy in front of a crowd

I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot

I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot

Ev'rybody sing:
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Hey!
Whoa!
Wooh!!
Whoa!
Ay, let 'em hear ya!

Let's go!


I said shout it to the rooftops!
Said, to the rooftops!
Come on!

Come on, let's go!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

Whoa!

Whoa!

Yea!

Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!

Yea!

Rise up!
When you're living on your knees, you rise up
Tell your brother that he's gotta rise up
Tell your sister that she's gotta rise up

When are these colonies gonna rise up?
When are these colonies gonna rise up?
When are these colonies gonna rise up?
When are these colonies gonna rise up?

Rise up!    
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!

Rise up!

I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory
When's it gonna get me?
In my sleep? Seven feet ahead of me?
If I see it comin', do I run or do I let it be?
Is it like a beat without a melody?
See, I never thought I'd live past twenty
Where I come from some get half as many
Ask anybody why we livin' fast and we laugh, reach for a flask
We have to make this moment last, that's plenty

Scratch that
This is not a moment, it's the movement
Where all the hungriest brothers with
Something to prove went?
Foes oppose us, we take an honest stand
We roll like Moses, claimin' our promised land
And? If we win our independence?
Is that a guarantee of freedom for our descendants?
Or will the blood we shed begin an endless
Cycle of vengeance and death with no defendants?
I know the action in the street is excitin'
But Jesus, between all the bleedin' 'n fightin'
I've been readin' 'n writin'
We need to handle our financial situation
Are we a nation of states? What's the state of our nation?
I'm past patiently waitin'. I'm passionately
Smashin' every expectation
Every action's an act of creation!
I'm laughin' in the face of casualties and sorrow
For the first time, I'm thinkin' past tomorrow

And I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot

We're gonna rise up! Time to take a shot!
We're gonna rise up! Time to take a shot!
We're gonna




Time to take a shot!


Time to take a shot!

Time to take a shot!

Take a shot!
Shot!
Shot!
A-yo it's
Time to take a shot!
Time to take a shot!
And I am-   
Not throwing away my shot

Not throwing away my shot

We're gonna

Rise up!
Rise up!



Rise up!
Rise up!



Rise up!

Rise up!

Ri- ri- ri-


Time to take a shot!
Time to take a shot!
And I am-

Not throwin' away my-

Not throwin' away my shot!
