\section{Tokenizing}
\subsection{Methods Used}
What methods did you use and try to tokenize the sonnets?
\subsection{Modifications}
Did you have to make changes to the way you tokenized after running the algorithm and seeing the results?

\section{Algorithm}
\subsection{Packages Used}
What packages did you use for the algorithm?
\subsection{Parameters Used}
What decisions did you have to make when running the algorithm and what did you try? e.g number of states
\subsection{Effect On Sonnets}
How did this affect the sonnets that were generated

\section{Poetry Generation}
\subsection{How?}
How did you generate your poem?
\subsection{How to get to look like a sonnet?}
How did you get your poem to look as much like a sonnet as possible?
\subsection{Do they make sense?}
What makes sense/what doesn't about the sonnets generated?

\section{Visualization and Interpretation}
\subsection{Hidden State Meaning}
For at least 5 hidden states give a list of the top 10 words that associate with this hidden state and state any common features these groups.
\subsection{Properties of Hidden States}
What are some properties of the different hidden states?
e.g. Correlation between hidden states and syllable counts, connotations of words, etc.
\subsection{Visual representation}
Make a visual representation of the correlation between states and words

\section{Additional Goals}
e.g. rhyme/meter

\section{Extra Credit: RNN}
What did you use to collect more data and what packages did you use for RNN/LSTM?
Compare/contrast the effect of these algorithms to HMM and why you think they were better or worse

\section{Conclusion}
\subsection{Division of work}
\subsection{Discoveries}
What are your conclusions/observations about the models you used and the sonnets generated?
\subsection{Challenges}
\subsection{Concluding Remarks}
